## Memory routing (universal-memory)

Tool note: the bullets below reference `memory_capture`. If that tool is not registered in this session but `memory_add` is (generic mem0), call `memory_add` instead — the routing guidance applies to either.

When the user says "remember", "note that", or similar:
- Project-scoped active work (current focus, in-flight tasks, open questions, decisions made today): no immediate action needed — the session-end pipeline will capture it in state.md and the session summary automatically.
- Durable facts the user will want later ("I prefer X", "my address is Y", "the API rotates quarterly"): call `memory_capture` with `type: fact` and `project: global` (cross-project) or `project: <current-project>` (project-scoped).
- Architecture decisions worth auditing later: call `memory_capture` with `type: adr` and `project: <current>`.
- Anything the user will likely search for by keyword later: call `memory_capture` (any appropriate type).
- **Conversational context worth preserving across surfaces** (e.g. "track this conversation", a significant exchange you'll revisit from Claude Code later, the current turn on its own): call `memory_append_turn` with `role` (user/assistant/system) + `content` + `project`. Unlike `memory_capture` (which writes a stable authored doc with structured frontmatter), `memory_append_turn` appends a raw turn that the NEXT session-end summary will consume. Use both when appropriate — a durable decision gets `memory_capture`; the context around the decision gets `memory_append_turn`.

When uncertain, prefer a capture call over trusting session-end — durable docs are easier to search than buried state.md entries.
