## [Unreleased]

### Changed (v1.1) — `UM_ENDPOINT` → `UM_SERVER_URL` consolidation (W1.5)

- **`UM_ENDPOINT` is now deprecated; rename to `UM_SERVER_URL`.** The old variable is still respected with a one-line deprecation warning on stderr; it will be removed in v1.2.
- A new shared endpoint resolver lives at `~/.local/share/um/lib/endpoint.sh`. Hooks (`auto-start`, `session-start`, `session-end`, `user-prompt-submit`) source it and call `um_resolve_endpoint` for the canonical URL. The CLI + auto-installed marker block already used `UM_SERVER_URL` directly; no operator-facing change there.
- If your `.env` or shell rc sets `UM_ENDPOINT`, rename it to `UM_SERVER_URL` (no other change required). If both are set with different values, `UM_SERVER_URL` wins and the resolver names which value was used. See `MIGRATION.md` `## v1.0 → v1.1`.
- Hook fail-soft fallback: if the resolver lib file isn't installed (pre-v1.1 install state), hooks fall back to inline `${UM_SERVER_URL:-${UM_ENDPOINT:-}}` resolution so they continue to work without re-running `install.sh`.

### W6.2 — Image size reduction

- **Server image: 598 MB → 288 MB** (310 MB saved, 51.8% reduction; compressed: 94 MB → 60 MB). Achieves the v1.0 W6.2 primary <350 MB target.
- Mechanism: a `patch-package`-applied transform of `mem0ai@2.4.6/dist/oss/index.mjs` converts 14 eager imports of unused-provider peerDeps (groq-sdk, @mistralai/mistralai, cloudflare, redis, @langchain/core/messages, @langchain/core/documents, @azure/search-documents, @azure/identity, @supabase/supabase-js ×2, pg, neo4j-driver, plus 2 of better-sqlite3 which mem0 still uses for its history manager) to fail-soft dynamic imports. The Dockerfile then surgically removes the unused-provider directories from `node_modules` after install + patch + prune.
- **Expected post-upgrade boot-log change:** operators tailing `docker logs` will see 12 new informational warns on every server boot, one per peer-skipped package — these are NOT errors:
  ```
  [mem0-patch] groq-sdk not installed (peer-skipped) — expected on boot per W6.2
  [mem0-patch] @mistralai/mistralai not installed (peer-skipped) — expected on boot per W6.2
  …
  [mem0-patch] neo4j-driver not installed (peer-skipped) — expected on boot per W6.2
  ```
  Filter with `docker logs ... | grep -v '\[mem0-patch\]'` if log noise matters; the lines are stable across boots and version-pinned to `mem0ai@2.4.6`. The `— expected on boot per W6.2` suffix is grep-able to this CHANGELOG entry.
- **Forward-compat for adding a peer-skipped provider later (source-build operators only):** the dynamic-import shape resolves at boot if the package is present in `node_modules/`, so an operator running a **custom source build** (`UM_BUILD_LOCAL=1` or directly editing `server/Dockerfile`) can add e.g. `npm install @mistralai/mistralai` to `package.json` AND remove the corresponding line from the Dockerfile's surgical-rm list — the `[mem0-patch] @mistralai/mistralai` warn then disappears at boot. **Operators extending the published GHCR image** (`FROM ghcr.io/goldenwo/universal-memory-server:1.0.0`) cannot just `RUN npm install <pkg>` because the package directory was already removed at the upstream deps stage; they would need to fork the Dockerfile.
- **Reconciliation procedure when mem0ai is bumped:** see `server/patches/README.md` (durable, in-repo). The source-hash pin at `server/patches/mem0ai+2.4.6.source.sha256` is verified at Docker build time — a mismatched hash fails the build LOUDLY rather than silently applying the patch against a mutated tarball.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-08

**v1.0 is the stabilization + public-release milestone.** No new features relative to v0.8; the work is making the existing surface externally consumable: distribution shape, public-repo polish, security review, walkthrough validation, marketplace listing, and release ceremony.

The cumulative arc that v1.0 ships, by version:

- **v0.2 (Apr 2026)** — Session continuity: stop-hook raw capture, LLM session summaries, per-project `state.md`, memory versioning, 10-tool MCP surface.
- **v0.3** — Cross-platform reach: Codex CLI plugin, Claude.ai / Claude Desktop / ChatGPT Desktop connection guides, OpenAPI 3.1 at `/openapi.yaml`, `um-tunnel` CLI.
- **v0.4** — Progressive disclosure: compact `{id, title, score, snippet}` reads by default, opt-in `?full=1`; standalone `um` CLI; schema-hygiene `tools/list` filter.
- **v0.5** — Cross-env first-class capture: `memory_append_turn` + `memory_checkpoint` from any MCP client; modular installer with NONINTERACTIVE overrides.
- **v0.6** — Bearer auth + ops foundations: per-IP rate limiter, structured logging with request IDs, `/metrics`, container entrypoint guards, claude-mem bridge.
- **v0.7** — Provider neutrality: openai / anthropic / google / ollama swappable per surface; embedding-stamp guard; `um reindex` CLI.
- **v0.8** — Orchestrator wiring + cleanup: `umAdd()` replaces `mem0.add()` everywhere; production embed/facts metrics now emit; v0.6 follow-up queue closed.
- **v1.0 (this release)** — Stabilize + publish (in progress).

### Added

- **`docs/walkthrough/macos-solo-dev.md`** (PR #52, 68318df) — fresh-eyes walkthrough doc for solo developers on macOS. 10 steps with explicit per-step Verify checks; Troubleshooting section; feedback rubric for the W2.2 fresh-eyes runner.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (PR #49, b491848) — public contributor guide. PR flow, conventional commits, test-plan format, code-review tiers (Sonnet vs paired-Opus), development principles, phase-boundary discipline.
- **`docs/decisions/0005-adr-invocation-model.md`** — accepted ADR for the post-v1.0 `create-adr` skill invocation: **Option A (`/adr` slash command)**. Reserves Option C (end-of-session batch) as a future safety net. (ADR file is gitignored locally; canonical record committed via this CHANGELOG entry.)
- **`server/test/cors-preflight.test.mjs`** — pins the CORS preflight contract: `Authorization` header is always advertised in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` so browser-origin clients aren't silently broken.
- **W6.4 logger redaction** — `UM_AUTH_TOKEN` value-redaction pattern (lazy-init at first emit) added to the layer-2 censor's `KEY_PATTERNS`. Defense-in-depth only.

### Changed

- **`SECURITY.md` expanded** (PR #49, b491848) — full disclosure policy via GitHub PVR, response timeline, supported-version table, in/out-of-scope matrix, hardening notes for operators. Preserves the v0.7+ Qdrant write-stamp known-limitation note verbatim.
- **README tone retuned** (PR #50, 37c3d63) — six version-narrative artifacts retired (`(new in v0.5)`, `(new in v0.6)`, `**In v0.6 they compose**`, `**v0.6 note**`, `**Recall-only through v0.4**`, deferred-Agents-SDK link). Upgrading section reframed to point at MIGRATION + CHANGELOG cumulatively, with a "pin a tag" advice line.
- **`server/docker-compose.yml` dual-mode** — pull-by-default. Default behavior: `docker compose up -d` pulls `ghcr.io/goldenwo/universal-memory-server:${UM_VERSION:-latest}` (~20s vs ~2-5min cold-build). Pin via `UM_VERSION` in `.env`. Build override via new `server/docker-compose.build.yml` (combine with `-f` chaining). `server/install.sh` detects `UM_BUILD_LOCAL=1` and forwards both files.
- **`compareTokens` hashes inputs to fixed-size SHA-256 digests** before timing-safe compare (`server/lib/auth.mjs`). Replaces the prior length-mismatch dummy-compare scheme. Length-independent timing.
- **CORS preflight** advertises `Authorization` in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` (`server/mem0-mcp-http.mjs`). Unblocks browser-origin bearer-auth flows that were silently rejected at the preflight stage.

### Fixed

- **`docs/research/2026-04-24-v0.6-verifications/V1-fixture-prep.sh`** (PR #49, b491848) — replaces hardcoded `REPO_ROOT="E:/Projects/universal-memory"` with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Closes the only "recommended regardless" finding from the W4.1 secrets audit.
- **`server/.env.example` UM_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED warning** — replaced pre-v0.6 stale text claiming "server accepts unauthenticated writes from ANY host" with current accurate description: writes are protected by bearer auth since v0.6; loopback bypass + token semantics referenced. (W6.4 nice-to-have.)
- **Rate-limit IP-key under reverse proxy** — added `UM_RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADER` env var (default unset) for installs behind Cloudflare Tunnel / nginx / Tailscale Funnel. When set, the rate limiter keys on the named forwarded-for header instead of the socket peer IP, preventing any client sharing the proxy from trivially bypassing limits. Documented spoof-safety conditions in `.env.example`. (W6.4 nice-to-have.)
- **`evictOneOldest()` O(n) — accepted as documented intentional design** (W6.4 nice-to-have). The current O(n)-on-admit approach is preferred over a periodic O(n) sweep that would spike p99 latency for unlucky requests. Per `server/lib/rate-limit.mjs:39-41`. No code change; CHANGELOG note records the deliberation. v1.x cleanup may revisit with an LRU rewrite if real-world workloads expose contention.
- **Issue [#47](https://github.com/goldenwo/universal-memory/issues/47) — OpenAI live-continuity flake mitigated** in `server/test/continuity.sh`. Live OpenAI mode occasionally returns empty/malformed output; `session-end.sh` correctly degrades by keeping existing state.md but on the FIRST session there's nothing to keep, so the test asserted on a never-created file. Steps 3 + 6 now retry up to 3 times with 2s backoff — matches the production pattern (a real user would just run another session). Per `feedback_test_integrity.md`: test still exercises real behavior (state.md created, summary written, headers present); only the retry envelope is new. Mocked mode (`UM_CONTINUITY_LIVE=0`) succeeds on attempt 1; retry is a no-op there.

### Docs

- **`docs/walkthrough/`** new directory with three platform walkthroughs:
  - `macos-solo-dev.md` (PR #52, 68318df) — primary, macOS-verified
  - `linux-solo-dev.md` — derived from macOS; GNU `stat`/`ss` adaptations + docker-group note
  - `windows-solo-dev.md` — derived from Linux; WSL2-primary path; native PowerShell deferred to v1.1+
  Both mirrors are unverified on their target platforms and explicitly invite W2.2 runner feedback for paper cuts.
- **MIGRATION.md `v0.7 → v0.8` and `v0.8 → v1.0` sections** — operator-facing notes per release transition. `v0.8 → v1.0` covers the distribution-shape change (pull-by-default), the W6.4 hardening trio, the cumulative bearer-auth posture summary, and the formalized post-v1.0 support window.
- **`server/.env.example`** — new "Image / version pin" section documents `UM_VERSION`, `UM_IMAGE`, `UM_BUILD_LOCAL` knobs. New "Mem0 history DB" guidance documents the persistent volume-mount pair. (PR #51 + this PR.)
- **15 GitHub topics applied** for discoverability: `ai-memory`, `llm`, `memory`, `claude`, `claude-code`, `mcp`, `model-context-protocol`, `codex-cli`, `mem0`, `qdrant`, `self-hosted`, `markdown`, `rag`, `semantic-search`, `session-continuity`.

### Verification

- W4.1 secrets audit: GO verdict (no real secrets in history; previous `git filter-repo` pass on `docs/decisions/` + `docs/plans/` held).
- W6.4 security review: 3 Important findings (CORS, compareTokens, logger redaction), 0 Critical. All three fixed.
- W6.1 history-DB persistence example shipped (PR #51, d3178b1).

## [0.8.0-alpha] — 2026-05-07

v0.8 in progress — the first landed slice is **G2 orchestrator wiring**:
production embed/facts metric emission. v0.7-alpha promised
`um_provider_tokens_total{surface=facts}` and similar for `embed`, but
those surfaces emitted zero — `mem0.add()` bypassed our orchestrators.
v0.8 G2 introduces `umAdd()` (`server/lib/add.mjs`), which routes
through `embed()` and `facts()` orchestrators, then upserts directly
into Qdrant via `@qdrant/js-client-rest`.

### Added

- **`server/lib/add.mjs`** — `umAdd()` orchestrator replacing all 6
  `mem0.add()` call sites (4 in `mem0-mcp-http.mjs`, 1 in
  `lib/embedding-stamp.mjs`, 1 in `cli/reindex.mjs`).
- **Provider methods:** real `embed()` on openai/google/ollama;
  `factsInvoke()` on all four providers (anthropic facts-only).
- **`um_facts_extracted_total` counter** — sums facts extracted per
  `(provider, model)`. Powers the operator alert
  `rate(um_facts_extracted_total[5m]) == 0` while
  `request_duration_seconds_count > 0` (pipeline succeeding but
  extracting nothing — provider misconfig?).
- **`@qdrant/js-client-rest`** promoted from transitive (via mem0) to
  direct server dependency, pinned to mem0's resolved version.
- **`scripts/check-no-mem0-add.sh`** — CI gate forbidding `mem0.add()`
  reappearance in `server/`/`cli/`.
- **Live round-trip test** at `server/test/add-live.test.mjs` (gated by
  `UM_LIVE_TESTS=1`, blocks merge when run) — verifies umAdd's payload
  schema is readable by `mem0.getAll`/`mem0.search`. Mirrors production's
  explicit `vectorStore: { provider: 'qdrant', config: {...} }` Memory
  wiring; mem0's default in-memory fallback would silently ship empty
  reads.
- **Mock-SDK + real-qdrant DE5 stamp roundtrip** at
  `server/test/add-stamp-roundtrip.test.mjs` (gated by
  `UM_QDRANT_INTEGRATION=1`). Companion to the live spike: exercises the
  full `writeStamp(via umAdd) → readStamp(via mem0.getAll)` chain against
  the compose-managed qdrant using `UM_TEST_MOCK_SDK=1` internally — no
  API keys needed. Closes the spec §8 "DE5 stamp roundtrip in boot-smoke"
  acceptance gap that mock-SDK boot-tests can't reach (they intentionally
  short-circuit `writeStamp`).
- **CI grep gate wired into `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`** as the first
  step after checkout, fail-fast before the stack comes up.
- **Qdrant host port mapping in `server/docker-compose.yml`** — loopback
  only by default (`127.0.0.1:6333:6333`), env-overridable via
  `UM_QDRANT_PORT`. Lets local devs introspect their qdrant via curl/MCP
  and lets the new integration test reach qdrant from the runner.

### Changed

- **Qdrant server image bumped `v1.11.3 → v1.13.0`** to match the
  `@qdrant/js-client-rest` 1.13.0 client pulled transitively by
  `mem0ai@2.4.6`. Two-minor-version mismatch was emitting a runtime
  warning on every qdrant client construction. Forward storage-format
  migration is automatic within a major version; existing operators
  pull the new image and `docker compose up -d --force-recreate qdrant`.

- **Behavior change for `infer:true`:** umAdd does NOT replicate mem0's
  semantic dedup (existing-memory query + LLM ADD/UPDATE/DELETE). Every
  extracted fact becomes a new ADD. Re-running the same `/api/add`
  request twice now creates 2 facts instead of 1. Callers depending on
  idempotent re-adds must use deterministic `metadata.id` and check
  before calling. Documented in spec §3 non-goals.
- **Reindex traffic shares prod metric labels** — v0.8 has no
  `target`/`caller_class` label on `um_provider_*`. A 10× reindex spike
  looks identical to a 10× user-write spike on dashboards. Adding a
  traffic-source label is a v0.9 candidate (spec §10).

### v0.8 follow-ups (cleanup queue, 2026-05-02 → 2026-05-07)

A series of small PRs closing the v0.6/v0.8 follow-up backlog. Behavior-
preserving except where called out. None of these change the public API
surface; they harden the install path, close test coverage gaps, and
finish the reindex CLI wiring.

#### Added

- **v0.8.1 vault frontmatter audit** (PR #38, d2b4ecd). Closes #37.
  Inline doc at `cli/reindex.mjs:530` recording the audit conclusion (no
  current writer emits `userId`/`user_id` in vault frontmatter; the
  conditional read is forward-compat). Regression test exercising the
  explicit-camel-`userId` path.
- **Stale-symlink replacement test** (PR #39, f6a8fce). Closes #22.
  T17 in `installer/install-plugin-cc.test.sh` mirrors the v0.4-class
  T9 invariants against `installer/install-plugin-cc.sh`. Wires
  `install-plugin-cc.test.sh` into `smoke.yml`'s `installer-test`
  matrix on ubuntu-latest + macos-latest.
- **`um-cli reindex` CLI wrapper** (PR #45, b8259b7). Five new exports
  in `cli/reindex.mjs`: `createMemoryInstance`, `createVaultAdapter`,
  `wrapOldMemoryForReindex`, `createQdrantClient`, `runReindex`,
  `main`. Top-level orchestrator sequences phases 1→7 with `--resume`
  gating per `state.phase_completed`; SIGINT handler around phase 3.
  CLI argv parsed via `node:util` parseArgs; flags `--confirm`,
  `--resume`, `--no-server-probe`, `--keep-old`, `--checkpoint-path`,
  `--dry-run`, `--help`. New `reindex` subcommand in `plugins/claude-
  code/universal-memory/bin/um` dispatches to the CLI.
- **DE12 e2e test fill** (PR #45, b8259b7). 3 scenarios in
  `cli/test/reindex-e2e.test.mjs` (UM_LIVE_TESTS-gated; operator-run):
  provider flip (openai → google), `--resume` mid-phase-3, `--resume`
  between phase-4 and phase-5. Replaces previous `assert.fail()`
  scaffolding.
- **CI wire-up for `install-plugin-codex.test.sh`** (PR #43, 23fda16).
  Companion to PR #39; closes the second half of the "shellchecked but
  never run end-to-end" gap. T13 (Codex detected) + T19 (Codex absent)
  now run in CI.

#### Changed

- **Shellcheck `--severity=style` restored** (PR #41, f2f11ca). Closes
  #23. 71 findings addressed: 65 real fixes + 6 justified inline
  disables. CI flag changes in `smoke.yml`: removed `--severity=
  warning`, added `-x` (follow `# shellcheck source=` directives), added
  `-P SCRIPTDIR` (resolve relative source paths against each script's
  own directory).
- **Plugin CLI exec bits** (PR #40, 3d6d8ba). Flipped git mode 100644 →
  100755 on 12 plugin CLIs in `plugins/claude-code/universal-memory/
  bin/`: `um`, `um-capture(.sh)`, `um-forget`, `um-list.sh`,
  `um-preview`, `um-recent.sh`, `um-search.sh`, `um-state.sh`,
  `um-supersede`, `um-tail.sh`, `um-tunnel`. Mode-only changes (blob
  hashes unchanged). Windows checkouts ignored Unix exec bits, masking
  the issue locally; fresh clones on Linux/macOS produced non-executable
  CLIs.
- **Reindex code split** (PR #46, be90f32). `cli/reindex.mjs` (1474 →
  1155 lines). Phases 4-6 moved to new `cli/lib/swap.mjs`; phase 7
  moved to new `cli/lib/archive.mjs`. Pure refactor: re-exports from
  `cli/reindex.mjs` keep existing imports unchanged.

#### Fixed

- **Windows `ln -s` silent-fallback launcher** (PR #42, 182bb58). Long-
  pending T15 failure in `installer/install-plugin-cc.test.sh`. git-bash
  on Windows silently copies on `ln -s` and returns exit 0; the bridge
  CLI's static ESM imports then fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a
  flat copy at `~/.local/bin/`. `installer/install-plugin-cc.sh` now
  re-checks `[ -L "$bin_link" ]` after `ln -s`; when false, writes a
  bash launcher that `exec`s node on the bridge source in the plugin
  install dir (where sibling files resolve).
- **macOS bash 3.2 empty-array under `set -u`** (PR #39, f6a8fce).
  `installer/install-plugin-cc.test.sh:97` `run_plugin_cc` helper
  expanded `"${env_vars[@]}"` directly. Bash 3.2 (macOS default) treats
  this as unbound when the array is empty. Fixed via `${arr[@]+
  "${arr[@]}"}` idiom.

#### Docs

- **ROADMAP refresh** (PR #44, df8ba39). Marked v0.8 G2 + v0.8.1 audit +
  cleanup queue as shipped. Updated operational debt to reflect Qdrant
  alignment as resolved.

## [0.7.0-alpha] — 2026-05-01

Provider-neutrality release. The memory server, MCP HTTP layer, and reindex
CLI work with **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Ollama** across all three
LLM surfaces (embedding, summarizer, facts) — previous releases were
OpenAI-only. Alpha: OpenAI paths and Anthropic-as-summarizer/facts are
production-ready; Google + Ollama paths are spec-compliant and unit-tested
but await first-user live validation.

### Added

- **Four-provider neutrality** — pick any combination per surface via
  `UM_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `UM_SUMMARIZER_PROVIDER`, `UM_FACTS_PROVIDER`
  (each accepts `openai` | `anthropic` | `google` | `ollama`). Optional
  `UM_FACTS_FALLBACK` for cross-provider facts fallback.
- **Provider registry** at `server/lib/provider/registry.mjs`; per-provider
  modules at `server/lib/provider/{openai,anthropic,google,ollama}.mjs`
  exposing a uniform contract per spec §3.2.
- **Surface dispatchers** — `server/lib/embed.mjs` + `server/lib/facts.mjs`
  (Pattern B: config translation for mem0); `server/lib/summarize.mjs`
  (Pattern A: direct dispatch).
- **Embedding-stamp guard** — server reads `_um_embedding_stamp` sentinel
  doc on boot and refuses to start if the configured embedder doesn't match
  the recorded provider/model/dim. Operator is pointed at `um-cli reindex`.
- **`cli/reindex.mjs`** — 7-phase reindex orchestrator with crash-safe
  resume (Adv-1 stamp-then-swap, Adv-4 atomic phase advance per spec §6.5);
  wrapped as `um-cli reindex --confirm`. ~941 lines.
- **`_um_embedding_stamp` system doc** — filtered from all read paths via
  `isSystemDoc()` so it never surfaces to recall, search, or list.
- **Wizard 4-path provider picker** — `installer/wizard-lib.sh` offers
  OpenAI-only / mix-providers / local-Ollama / skip-and-edit during
  install.sh interactive mode.
- **`um_provider_*` Prometheus metrics** — `tokens_total`, `cost_total`,
  `request_duration_seconds`, `errors_total` per provider × surface. The
  `SURFACES` enum in `server/lib/metrics.mjs` is the single source of truth
  for metric labels (`'embed'`, `'summarize'`, `'facts'`).
- **R11 secret redaction** — pino redaction at log emission for `sk-`,
  `sk-ant-`, `AIza`, and `Bearer` patterns; covers headers, URL params,
  and free-form message strings. Pattern order matters: `sk-ant-` precedes
  `sk-` so greedy match doesn't consume the prefix.
- **Mocked-SDK boot smoke** (`UM_TEST_MOCK_SDK=1`) — every provider config
  can be smoke-tested without real API keys.
- **`docs/contributing/add-provider.md`** — 6-touch checklist for adding a
  fifth provider.
- **`MIGRATION.md` §`v0.6 → v0.7`** — env-var rename table + reindex
  decision tree.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Env-var renames per pre-1.0 hard-break policy (no fallback
  shims; see `MIGRATION.md` §`v0.6 → v0.7`):
  - `UM_SUMMARIZER` → `UM_SUMMARIZER_PROVIDER`
  - `UM_SUMMARIZE_MODEL` → `UM_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`
  - `MEM0_LLM_MODEL` → `UM_FACTS_MODEL`
  - `MEM0_EMBEDDER_MODEL` → `UM_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
- **Breaking:** `installer/install.sh --yes` now refuses on missing API key
  (was permissive in v0.6).
- `mem0ai` exact-pinned to `2.4.6` (R1 mitigation — guards against silent
  SDK-pin drift that pruned `ollama` from `node_modules` and broke 18 test
  files).

### Fixed

- R11 redaction wired in **both** `makeLogger()` (test path) and
  `getLogger()` → `base()` → `buildOptions()` (production path). Initial
  implementation only covered the test path; caught in PR review.

### Security

- Secret patterns redacted from logs at emission time (R11) — covers
  OpenAI (`sk-`), Anthropic (`sk-ant-`), Google (`AIza`), and any
  `Bearer <token>` headers.

### Test signal

- 589 server unit tests / 583 pass / 0 fail / 6 skipped
- 34 wizard tests, 0 fail
- 66 install tests, 0 fail
- 36 CLI tests / 33 pass / 3 skipped (UM_LIVE_TESTS-gated)
- CI: smoke + cross-platform installer (ubuntu + macos) all SUCCESS
- DE1 §6.1 live spike (real qdrant + openai): mem0 `metadata.id` roundtrips ✅
- FIN1 anthropic-as-facts: live Claude call extracts facts ✅

### Tracked v0.8 follow-ups (none block this alpha — see `ROADMAP.md` §v0.8)

## [0.6.0-alpha] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- Bearer auth on `/api/*` and `/mcp` with loopback + forwarded-header safe default (§4.2)
- Structured pino logging with `request_id` propagation
- `/metrics` Prometheus exposition (5 bound metrics, loopback-only default)
- Per-IP token-bucket rate limiter with bounded map + LRU eviction
- `um-bridge-claude-mem` — one-way ingest from `~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db`
- BRIDGES.md registry; `source:` discriminator in vault frontmatter
- `<external-summary>` untrusted-content boundary for bridge-ingested records
- Shared `_dump_on_fail` test harness (`installer/lib/test-harness.sh`)
- Container entrypoint guard refusing root+rw+writes-enabled (#28)
- UM_CONTAINER_USER change warning on re-run (#30)
- CLI friendly-error translation via `_um_curl_wrap` (401/429/503/5xx)
- `server/lib/jsonrpc-errors.mjs` — string-to-numeric JSON-RPC code map + `toJsonRpcError()` helper
- `server/test/error-shape.test.mjs` — cross-cutting per-endpoint envelope-shape gate; catches future regressions where a handler forgets the unified envelope helper
- `server/test/jsonrpc-errors.test.mjs` — JSON-RPC code-map unit tests (every stable code mapped, fallback to `-32603`)

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `/api/list` envelope → `{results: [...]}`
- **Breaking:** Unified §5.1 error envelope across every endpoint (B.13). Every 4xx/5xx from `/api/*` returns `{ok:false, error:{code, message, retryable}}` with a stable `code` from the §5.2 prefix-groups (`AUTH_*`, `INPUT_*`, `STATE_*`, `LIMIT_*`, `UPSTREAM_*`, `SERVER_*`). Replaces the legacy `{error:'<string>'}` and `{schema_version:1, ok:false, error:'<string>'}` shapes. The local `errorResponse` helper in `server/mem0-mcp-http.mjs` is removed — single source of truth is now `server/lib/error-envelope.mjs`. OpenAPI `ErrorResponse` schema updated to match.
- **Breaking:** `/mcp` JSON-RPC dual-shape — tool errors return the §5.1 unified envelope inside `result.content[0].text` (JSON-encoded, replacing the old free-form `"Error: <msg>"` plain text). Outer JSON-RPC envelope errors (parse error, method not found) carry a numeric `error.code` in the `-32xxx` range, mapped from the stable string code by `server/lib/jsonrpc-errors.mjs`.
- **Breaking:** `/openapi.yaml` (full) now default-secure — auth-required + loopback-only
- **Breaking:** Request-body cap `UM_HTTP_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (default 2 MB) — clients sending larger payloads receive 413 `INPUT_TOO_LARGE`
- **Breaking:** `/metrics` now default-secure loopback-only — ops with existing Prometheus scrape from non-loopback must set `UM_METRICS_LOOPBACK_ONLY=false` + configure `UM_METRICS_AUTH_REQUIRED`
- mem0/qdrant calls now retry 3× with 100/200/400 ms jittered backoff before surfacing `UPSTREAM_FAILURE` — p99 latency may shift by ~700 ms on transient upstream failures (previously surfaced immediately)
- Cross-process lockdir replaces Perl flock + proper-lockfile (server+plugin)
- O_NOFOLLOW on all vault writes (symlink-swap fix)

### Fixed
- Typeof-string guard on timestamp inputs
- #20, #21, #28, #29, #30 (backlog)

### Security
- Constant-time token compare (A1)
- Forwarded-header default-deny on loopback (10-header list forces auth even from 127.0.0.1 when any proxy/tunnel indicator present) — tunnel-safety default
- `<external-summary>` marker blocks prompt-injection from bridge sources (A3) — REJECT-on-literal-marker (LLM-entity-decode bypass fix)
- `/metrics` default-secure posture (A2)
- `/openapi.yaml` auth-required default (A4)
- Bridge `--db-path` realpath + allowlist (rejects UNC paths, absolute escapes, symlinks outside `~/.claude-mem/`)

## [0.5.0-alpha] — 2026-04-23

Cross-env first-class release. Non-CC surfaces (Claude.ai, ChatGPT Desktop,
Codex) can now append turns and trigger session summaries directly via MCP,
without Claude Code hooks. Modular installer with interactive wizard.
Shared prompt templates + `UM_PROMPT_DIR`. I4 fix for `claude-agent-sdk`.

### Added

- **`memory_append_turn` MCP tool + `POST /api/append-turn` REST endpoint** —
  append a conversation turn (`project`, `content`, `role` required;
  `timestamp`, `conversation_id` optional) directly to the raw-capture pipeline.
  Enables Claude.ai, ChatGPT Desktop, and Codex to feed turns to the vault
  without Claude Code's Stop hook. Flock-protected file writes prevent turn
  corruption within the node server (concurrent `memory_append_turn` calls)
  and within Claude Code (concurrent `stop.sh` invocations). Cross-process
  bash↔node races on the same raw-capture file are a known v0.6 hardening
  item — stop.sh writes complete in <10ms so practical overlap is rare, but
  not zero. Log-injection guard on project value.
- **`memory_checkpoint` server-side implementation** — triggers full
  session-end pipeline (summary + state merge + reindex) from any MCP surface
  via `POST /api/checkpoint`. Drops v0.4 stub; see MIGRATION.md.
- **Modular install flags** — `install.sh` is now the unified entry point with
  composable component flags: `--server`, `--plugin-cc`, `--plugin-codex`,
  `--cli`, `--all`, plus `--interactive`, `--yes`, `--dry-run`.
- **Interactive wizard** — `install.sh` auto-triggers a numeric-menu walkthrough
  when run with no flags in a TTY. `--yes` skips it; `--dry-run` prints without
  executing.
- **Shared prompt templates** — `summarize.txt` + `update-state.txt` prompts
  extracted to `server/config/prompts/` and written to the vault at install time.
- **`UM_PROMPT_DIR` env var** — installer writes this to the managed block in
  `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc` for plugin-cc installs. `hooks/lib/summarize.sh` +
  `update-state.sh` read prompts from this path; fall back to plugin-local
  `hooks/lib/prompts/` if unset. Eliminates prompt drift between CC plugin and
  server paths.
- **Rubric-drift-gate test** — `server/test/rubric-drift.test.mjs` asserts that
  rubric blocks in all 5 mirror files match the canonical
  `docs/memory-routing-rubric.md`. 1 pass, 0 fail.
- **BACKENDS registry in `summarize.mjs`** — groundwork for v0.7
  provider-neutrality (Anthropic/Google/Ollama swap). Allows adding new
  summarization backends without touching the dispatch core.
- **Backend fallback for `claude-agent-sdk` server-side** — when
  `UM_SUMMARIZER=claude-agent-sdk` is configured in server `.env`,
  `memory_checkpoint` (server-side) falls back to `openai`/`ollama` with a
  warning log; Docker cannot spawn a host-side Claude Code process.

### Changed

- **`memory_checkpoint` no longer a stub** — the v0.4 actionable-error response
  (`"use /um-checkpoint or hooks/session-end.sh"`) is replaced with a real
  server-side implementation. Existing CC users see no behavior change;
  Claude.ai / ChatGPT Desktop / Codex users gain the ability to trigger state
  refresh directly.
- **`install.sh` is unified entry point** — supports composable component flags.
  `install-cli.sh` continues as the v0.4 back-compat entry point for CLI-only
  installs; its behavior is unchanged.
- **Plugin-copy logic extracted** — refactored from `server/install.sh` into
  `installer/install-plugin-cc.sh` + `installer/install-plugin-codex.sh`.
- **`hooks/lib/summarize.sh` + `update-state.sh`** — now read prompts via
  `$UM_PROMPT_DIR` (falls back to plugin-local `hooks/lib/prompts/`).

### Fixed

- **I4 (`claude-agent-sdk` system prompt)** — `summarize.sh` now prepends
  `_UM_SYSTEM_PROMPT` before piping the transcript when using the
  `claude-agent-sdk` backend. Fixes a silent quality regression where the
  system prompt was omitted for this non-default config.
- **`stop.sh` flock-protected** — raw-capture appends use Perl
  `Fcntl::flock` via a sibling lockfile. No turn corruption under concurrent
  writes.
- **`installer/lib/marker-block.sh` idempotency** — re-running `install.sh` or
  `install-cli.sh` now leaves `~/.bashrc` at a stable line count. In v0.4.0-alpha
  the helper prepended a leading `\n` on every write but awk didn't strip the
  blank line that the prior run had written, so each re-install grew the bashrc
  by 1 blank line (unbounded over many runs). Fix: awk now buffers blank lines
  and discards the buffer when it sees the marker-start sentinel. Regression
  tests added to `installer/install-cli.test.sh` (T8) and `server/install.test.sh`
  (T18 extended). See commit `46e8700`.
- **`um` dispatcher standalone-install fallback** — `um --version` failed the
  6-lib health check whenever `UM_LIB_DIR` was unset for standalone installs.
  Fix: two-tier fallback — env var first, then standalone layout
  (`~/.local/share/um/lib`), then plugin-context layout. Regression test T11
  added to `bin/um.test.sh`. See commit `7c0b026`.
- **`server/test/smoke.sh` T10-E broadened** — `memory_checkpoint` is in
  `WRITE_TOOL_NAMES` so the writes-gate error fires before the stub error when
  `UM_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=false`. Assertion now accepts either error message. See
  commit `5b2cd6c`.

### Security

- **Flock-protected raw-capture appends** — concurrent `memory_append_turn` or
  Stop-hook writes to the same day-file are now serialized via a Perl
  `Fcntl::flock` sibling lockfile. Prevents partial-write turn corruption.
- **Log-injection guard in `append-turn.mjs`** — raw project value is sanitized
  before appearing in error-message log output.

## [0.4.0-alpha] — 2026-04-21

Hybrid-rebalance release. Five phases (0, B.1, B.3, A, D) plus docs capstone
(E) across 85 commits and three rounds of dual-Opus design review. Headline:
progressive disclosure cuts 41.9% of single-hop tool-call context on reads,
and a first-class `um` CLI replaces ad-hoc curl for everyday vault work.
All Critical / Important / Scalability findings from review are resolved;
ten Minor findings are deferred to v0.5.

### Added

- **Progressive disclosure on read responses** (Phase B.1). REST
  `/api/search`, `/api/list`, `/api/recent/{project}` and MCP `memory_search`,
  `memory_list`, `memory_recent` return compact `{id, title, score, snippet}`
  (~200-byte snippet = title + first 240 chars of body) by default. Opt into
  full bodies via `?full=1` (REST) or `full: true` (MCP). 41.9% single-hop
  context reduction measured against v0.3 baseline using the 20-query
  fixture.
- **`GET /api/recent/{project}`** REST endpoint — filesystem mtime-sorted
  recent session summaries. Parity with MCP `memory_recent`.
- **`um` CLI** (Phase A). Seven subcommands — `um search`, `um state`,
  `um recent`, `um list`, `um capture`, `um tail`, `um --version` — behind a
  dispatcher with a shared `hooks/lib/config.sh` KEY=value loader (env
  overrides repo `.um/config` overrides user `~/.um/config`). Standalone
  installer at `installer/install-cli.sh`. Shared project-resolution lib at
  `hooks/lib/resolve-project.sh`. Reference: `docs/um-cli.md`.
- **`installer/install-cli.sh`** standalone CLI installer (Phase D).
  Git-clone-based; writes an env-sourced managed block into `~/.bashrc` /
  `~/.zshrc`. Cross-platform CI matrix on ubuntu + macOS. Companion doc:
  `installer/install-cli.md`.
- **Shared `installer/lib/marker-block.sh`** sourced by both
  `install.sh` (full-server) and `install-cli.sh` (CLI-only) so the two
  installers emit identical rc-file blocks.
- **Token-cost measurement harness** at `server/test/token-cost.test.mjs`
  with a 20-query fixture + checked-in baseline JSONs (Phase 0 / B.1).
- **Schema drift gate**: `server/test/custom-gpt-actions.test.mjs`
  byte-matches `plugins/chatgpt-custom-gpt/universal-memory/actions-trimmed.yaml`
  against `openapi.mjs`'s generator output so the Custom GPT action spec
  cannot silently drift from the canonical schema.

### Changed

- **BREAKING for REST consumers**: `/api/search` and `/api/list` default
  response shape is now `{id, title, score, snippet}` (compact) instead of
  the full body with `metadata`. Pass `?full=1` to opt into full bodies.
  See `MIGRATION.md`.
- **BREAKING for MCP clients reading full bodies**: `memory_search`,
  `memory_list`, `memory_recent` return compact shape by default. Pass
  `full: true` in tool arguments to opt back in.
- **BREAKING for MCP listTools consumers**: `tools/list` returns 4 read
  tools by default (`memory_search`, `memory_list`, `memory_state`,
  `memory_recent`). The 7 write tools (`memory_add`, `memory_append_turn`,
  `memory_capture`, `memory_checkpoint`, `memory_delete`, `memory_forget`,
  `memory_supersede`) are filtered out unless `UM_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=true`
  on the server. Direct `tools/call` against a filtered tool still returns
  `{ ok: false, error: "MCP writes disabled" }` (graceful) — commit
  `0cb912b`.
- `memory_recent` MCP tool now reads the filesystem directly (mtime-sorted)
  via `doRecent()` — previously wrapped `memory_search('session_summary',
  ...)` in v0.3. REST `/api/recent/{project}` has parity. `project` arg now
  required (commits `b9ed0cb`, `e956641`).
- Summarizer prompt compressed 35.5% and default model dropped to the cheap
  tier (commit `524cf0e`).
- Read-tool MCP descriptions trimmed — verbose examples moved to
  `docs/mcp-tools.md` (commit `2fd7cc6`).
- Install docs pivoted from `curl | bash` to `git clone + bash
  installer/install-cli.sh` for the standalone CLI (commit `267ba27`). The
  full-server `installer/install.sh` still supports `curl | bash` via
  self-bootstrap.
- `UM_LIB_DIR` env override wired into all `bin/um*` scripts (commits
  `d3ea4ad`, `92be508`) — lets the installer place hook libs at
  `~/.local/share/um/lib/` without requiring the full plugin tree.

### Fixed

Server:

- `/api/list` now honors `?limit` (was silently ignored — commit `5b3bd2d`).
- `decodeURIComponent` on `/api/state/{project}` path — URL-encoded project
  slugs parse correctly (commit `b42223c`).
- `doState` race-tolerance — non-ENOENT I/O errors log and return
  `state:null` instead of crashing (commits `3f838b1`, `47d3a29`).
- OpenAPI `id` field descriptions now read as filename stem (not mem0
  UUID); `actions-trimmed.yaml` regenerated (commit `5ca00a1`).
- `doRecent` surrogate-safe snippet slice + race-tolerant file reads
  (commit `a5bbd39`).
- MCP `memory_recent` now calls `doRecent` — was silently diverging from
  REST (commit `e956641`).
- Snippet-design fixture relocated to `server/config/` for Docker-image
  safety (commit `aaeaccd`).
- 500-response sanitization — `err.message` scrubbed in the top-level catch
  (commit `4ac9026`).

CLI:

- `um` usage log drops PII — logs `{timestamp, subcommand, arg_count}` only
  (commit `de69f2a`).
- `resolve-project.sh` slug validation — path-traversal guard; e.g.
  `--project "../evil"` rejected (commit `406a184`).
- `um.test.sh` uses an isolated temp dir (previously destroyed real
  subcommand files on cleanup — commit `3257038`).
- `um-tail.sh` sed unescape order fix for bodies with literal backslashes
  (commit `e3473b5`).
- CLI error messages surface `curl` exit code (`-fSsm` replaces `-sfm` —
  commit `171d530`).
- `um-capture` emits `exit 1` on write failure (commit `182539a`).
- `um-forget` / `um-supersede` honor `UM_SERVER_URL` with `UM_ENDPOINT`
  back-compat fallback (commit `bedb0e6`).
- `vault.sh` `date -d` BSD fallback for macOS `find_orphans` (commit
  `6440464`).

Installer:

- `install-cli.sh` guards `SHELL` / `HOME` unbound under `set -u` (commit
  `8ea2a07`).
- `install.sh` honors env-sourced contract (dropped silent Case-2 skip per
  plan RH6 — commit `a6e9dd5`).
- `marker-block.sh` same-dir mktemp + trap cleanup for atomic `mv` (commit
  `60185ca`); escapes single quotes in values (commit `be87cd7`).
- `install-cli.sh` verifies library + script copy success — no silent fail
  (commit `42dc103`).
- `um-tunnel` now copied by the installer; T1 label corrected from symlink
  to dispatcher (commit `9a983b7`).

CI:

- softprops release-asset action pinned to SHA + pre-check installer asset
  exists (commit `7dacb65`).
- Installer cross-platform matrix — ubuntu + macOS (commit `26f8e66`).
- `um.test.sh` uses a portable sed redirect — BSD-compatible (commit
  `8d0ccae`).

### Security

- MCP write tools are now hidden from the default `tools/list` response
  when `UM_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=false` (default). Reduces accidental exposure
  of write capability to clients that discover tools via `tools/list`
  (Phase B.3, commit `0cb912b`).
- `GET /openapi.yaml` documented as intentionally unauthenticated — exposes
  schema only, no vault contents. See `docs/mcp-tools.md` Security section.
- Usage log stripped of PII (see CLI `de69f2a` above).

### Deprecated / Removed

- `installer/um-cli/lib/` duplicate removed; `install-cli.sh` now copies
  libs directly from `plugins/claude-code/universal-memory/hooks/lib/`
  (commit `714eb8f`).
- `um validate` subcommand dropped per Phase 0.5b (vault-as-git signal
  absent at gate). Phase A ships 7 subcommands, not 8.

### Notes / known limitations

- `/api/list` response envelope is still a raw array, not
  `{results: [...]}`. Intentionally preserved for backward compatibility
  per Phase B.1.4b — will be unified with `/api/search` and `/api/recent`
  in a future release. Not a regression in v0.4.
- Max-transcript tokenization projection (research doc §1 row 4b) is
  likely ~2× understated; the sample is BPE-optimal. Measurement
  methodology flagged for v0.5 tightening.
- `claude-agent-sdk` summarizer mode pipes the transcript but not the
  system prompt — a silent quality regression for that non-default config.
  Tracked as I4 for v0.5 (`summarize.sh` needs to prepend
  `_UM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
